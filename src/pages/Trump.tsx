    <p>
      Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. My
      placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.
      You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a
      young, and beautiful, piece of text.

    <p>
      I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and
      I've said a lot of things.

    <p>If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.</p>

      I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words
      it's unbelievable. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. You
      could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her
      wherever. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these
      words it's unbelievable. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d
      be dating it.

      I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its
      family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's
      inappropriate. It's not nice."
